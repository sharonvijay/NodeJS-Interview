# Asynchronous Callback and Promise and their States

## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a fundamental concept in JavaScript and other programming languages, allowing tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the main thread. Callbacks and promises are two common mechanisms used for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

This README provides an overview of asynchronous callback functions and promises, along with their states.

## Asynchronous Callback

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed after the completion of a task. In asynchronous programming, callbacks are often used to handle the result of asynchronous operations.

### Callback States

1. **Pending**: The initial state when an asynchronous operation is initiated but has not yet completed.

2. **Fulfilled/Resolved**: The state indicating that the asynchronous operation has completed successfully, and the result is available.

3. **Rejected**: The state indicating that the asynchronous operation encountered an error and was unsuccessful.

## Promise

A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

### Promise States

1. **Pending**: The initial state when a promise is created but has not yet been fulfilled or rejected.

2. **Fulfilled/Resolved**: The state indicating that the promise has been fulfilled, meaning the asynchronous operation completed successfully.

3. **Rejected**: The state indicating that the promise has been rejected, meaning the asynchronous operation encountered an error.

## Conclusion

Understanding asynchronous callback functions and promises, along with their states, is essential for effective asynchronous programming in JavaScript. By mastering these concepts, developers can write more efficient and scalable asynchronous code.
